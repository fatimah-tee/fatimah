<h2><p>My name is Raji fatimah oluwatoyin.I hail from offa,kwara state to be precise from the family of six.my religion is islam.
Firstly,i would like to start from my secondary school days.i attended unilorin secondary school ilorin kwara state,Nigeria.During my secondary school
i participated in alot of activities like the press club,drama and cultural dance,and i also had the opportunity to visit alot of places.My achievement during
my secondary school days was that i was given the post of the social prefect,and  able to interact with different types of people in life and to be bold and confident
of myself anywhere life leads me to.Moreover,i had to meet alot of people from different background,tribe and most importantly character.My days at secondary school was that 
i had to understand alot of people on earth.i found out that life changes gradually.Finally,i was given admission to a world class university"KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY MALETE" located at 
ilorin kwara state in a department of library and information science from the college of information communication and technology(ICT) 200l.
While there are some similarities between my secondary school days and my university days.its just that i could say my university days is more advanced than my secondary school.
My achievement has not been that much but with the few one i have learnt,my university has taught me to be careful of people whom i relate with in life not 
everyone is meant to be trusted.</p></h2>
